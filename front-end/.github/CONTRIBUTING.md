# Innersearch Contributing Guide
Hi there, we are really glad that you are interested in contributing to InnerSearch. 

If you have any questions, proposal of new feature or bug to report just create a new [issue.](https://github.com/InnerSearch/vue-innersearch/issues)


## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- Work in the `src` folder and **DO NOT** checkin `dist` in the commits.

- Make sure `npm run cypress:run` passes.
